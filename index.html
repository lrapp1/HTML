              Laura Rapp is a current student at Columbus State Community College (CSCC) studying Software and Mobile App Development. As a child growing up in Central Ohio, she had dreams of becoming an artist and received a Bachelor of Fine Art as well as an Art and Design Education Licensure from the University of Cincinnati in 2018. She has been teaching art ever since.<br><br> 

              Computer Science and the Visual Arts may seem vastly different, however, both fields have the potential for a limitless creative universe that is up to the artist or developer to imagine. Different tools are used depending on the project (program), but the processes involved are the same:<br><br> 

              Product conception<br> 
    
              Product is broken down into manageable, incremental steps<br>  

              Steps are performed in order of immediate importance<br> 

              Regular implementation of feedback and critique throughout the product life cycle<br> 

              Final revisions or formal critique before product release<br><br> 

              The world has been irrevocably changed from society’s increasing reliance upon technology, so much so that our digital identity is just as important (if not more so) as our physical one.<br><br> 

              The Internet of Things (IoT), the technological system which connects all objects (with internet capability) online has irrevocably changed how society functions.

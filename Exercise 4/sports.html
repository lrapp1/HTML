    <h1>This webpage is dedicated to the Puppy Bowl, which is a sports
competition played by puppies. This page also describes some of my favorite sports to watch.
    </h1>
    <p> 
I chose the Puppy Bowl as my favorite sport to watch because I think puppies are cute. They are very energetic and always try their best, the perfect combination for a winning sports team. If you don't really enjoy watching regular human sports, you will enjoy 
watching puppies. Oher than that I included, "Shuffleboard, Online Poker", and, "Hot Dog Eating Contests", as my other favorites, because I find sports incredibly boring and a waste of time, so I tried to comeup with the most ridiculous sports that I could think of.

      </div>

      <div class= "yellow rounded">
        <p>Width sets an elements width. <br> Max-width sets the maximum width of an element, and prevents the value specified in width from becoming larger than the value defined in max-width. Max-width controls width, but min-width can override max-width when the rule is used.<br> Min-width sets the minimum value of an element so that when used in the width property, the value specified will not be smaller than min-width. Min-width is implemented when it's value is larger than width or max-width.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class= "yellow shadow">
        <p>Box-shadow property is used to apply drop shadows to an element's box. There are four items that can be applied to the property: Horizontal offset (the distance the shadow travels from the original box, right is positive while left is negative. Vertical offset (the distance the shadow travels from the original box across the y-axis. Up is negative while down is positive. Blur radius (amount of blurring applied to the shadow), and base color (the color of the shadow). You can also specify multiple box shadows in a single box-shadow declaration by seperating them with commas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="seethrough">
        <p>Opacity is a CSS property that can set the opacity (how opaque or see-through an object is) of an object. This is not transparency because it is used to hide content, not make it clearer.</p>
